#Array-Clone
The array structure is commonly found in most programming languages as a primitive type, but Python only provides the list structure for creating mutable sequences. We can define the Array ADT to represent a one-dimensional array for
use in Python that works similarly to arrays found in other languages. It will be used throughout this project when an array structure is required.
